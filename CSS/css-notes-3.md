### 1.Sass attribute selector 

If there is need to style a part of the elements within the tag, there can use `[]` selector to style all of them:

```
[class^="col"]{
   background-color:red; 
} 
```
**`[class^="col"]`** means any class name start with `col` will be selected, Also:

**`[class$="col"]`** means any class name end with 'col' will be selcted, Also:

**`[class*="col"]`** means any class name contains 'col' will be selected.


### 2.`not()` sudo elements: 

```
.col{
   &:not(:last-child){
            margin-right:20px;
        }
}
```
This selects every child from `col`class except the last-child.


### 3. In Sass,naming variables inside `calc()` function has to use `#{}`on the target varibale, this is called as [interpolate](https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/818):

```
$width = 100px;
calc(100% - #{$width});
```

### 4. Sass re-use ultility classes:
The ultility classes re-used for achieve a simple or some specific purposes, such as by adding the `text-align:center` to its child elements:
```
//adding .center-text class
<div class='center-text'>
  <p>some text</p>
</div>
```

the `center-text` class are resued within the `_utilities.scss` file:
```
.center-text:{text-align:center}
```
### 5. `@import` in sass and partial files:

In Sass, it always using underscore to naming the partial files like `_partial.scss`. The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file.

to import partial files as: **`@import foldername/partial`**  as the underscore and file extension name is not required.

### 6. `filter` property:

apply graphical effects like blurring or color shifting to an element, most used on images,background and border

**`filter:blur()`** blur() function take pixles as paramenters,does not accept percentage value 

**`filter:brightness()`** brightness() function accepts percentage, **0** means completely black, **100%** means no change

**`filter:contrast()`** contrast() functon accept percentage input, **0**  means completely gray, **100%** means no change

### 7. `object-fit` property:

specifies how the contents of a **replaced element**, such as an <img> or <video>, should be resized to fit its container. In which the container has default size such as `width:100%; height:100%`, `object-fit`will just resize the content to fit, such as the `background-size`property work
   
```
img{
   width:100%;
   height:100%;
   object-fit:cover}
   ```
   

### 8. `:root`sudo class is pretty same like `html` element unless its has stronger specificty

Also `:root` is often used to declare CSS custom global variables:

```
:root{
    --color-primary: #eb2f64;
    --color-primary-light: #FF3366;
    --color-primary-dark: #BA265D;
}
body{color: var(--color-primary)};

```
   
### 9. Include SVG via sprites: 

**9.1 SVG files only loaded/displayed properly via webserver.**

```
<svg class='icon'>
   <use xlink:href="sprite.svg#icon-name"></use>
</svg>
```

**9.2 the `#icon-name` refers to the SVG file `icon-name.svg`, and `xlink:`shouldn't use any more.**

and it should repalced with `href`:**

```
  <use href="sprite.svg#icon-name" class="icon"></use>
```
but this is not fully supported in safari browsers, so it should always include with `xlink:` when dealing with different browsers

**9.3 `fill` adding color to the SVG image**
```
.icon{ fill:teal} 
```
:coffee: *when styling SVG icons, they are always treated as squares, so it should be styling width and height both.*

*but when styling a `IMG` tag, styling width or height (one of them) would work just fine*



### 10. User agent style sheet and `inital` property:

User agent style sheet are given by the browser as default, it will re-write your custom stylesheet, 

to avoid that by using `reset.css` or `normalize.css`. 

**:coffee: If `<!DOCTYPE html>` in the start is omitted,  the browser gives preference to the *user agent stylesheet***



### 11. `currentColor` property:

`currentColor` inherited color value from its own or its parents elements(own color value > parent color value).

```
.parent{color:teal}
.child{color:black; border:1px solid currentColor} // child element has black border
```

### 12. `-webkit-mask` vs `-webkit-clip-path`:

*CSS Clipping just uses the geometry of the shape. Because of this, certain visual elements wonâ€™t be applied*

*apply complex, detailed, and shapes with varying opacity over another element, for example:*
```
.mask{
   background-color:teal; //color change and the mask image color will change
   -webkit-mask-image:url(mask.svg);
   -webkit-mask-size:cover;
}
```


### 13. `figure` tag is perfect for the review content in the page:

`figure` is not only for images and pictures, it also great for some texts and description of images
