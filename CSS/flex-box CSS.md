### 3. `flex-box` not only can be applied into child elements, but also can be applied to its child contents

```
<span>text</span>
span{display:flex; justify-content:center}
```
the `text` content sit in the center of its container

By setting the `margin:auto` the **target flex item** can be centered within the container.

`justify-content:center` center **all the flex items** within the container.
