Something need to be noticed in React
========

1.  _In `Class components`, there is not need to initialize state with `this.state`_.

    it used to be initialized inside the `constructor()`function:
    ```javascript 
    //old way
    Class App extends React.components{ 
        consctuctor(props){
            super()
            this.state = {age:13}
        };
    }
    ```
    but Babel provide a short syntax outside the `consturctor()`:
    ```javascript 
    //new way
    Class App extends React.components{ 
       state = {age:123}
    }
    ```

* _Be ware `render()`methods only purpose is to return `jsx` instead of doing anything else, and don't make multipy return statement inside `render()`._

* _`componentDidMount()` is the perfect location to do some initial data loading for your component or to kickof outside process but it only **invoked one time.**_

* _Better not use `constructor` to initialzie data loading , even you can do it._
